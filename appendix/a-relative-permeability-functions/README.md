# ☑️ A: RELATIVE PERMEABILITY FUNCTIONS

TOUGH4 retains the same relative permeability functions for two-phase or three-phase flow problems. Table lookup using the user provided table as a new approach has been introduced  for both relative permeability and capillary pressure function. To make this report self-contained, we duplicate the Appendix for the discussion of relative permeability functions and the capillary pressure functions from TOUGH3 user manual (Jung et al., 2018).

The three-phase functions from TMVOC and ECO2 start at _IRP_ = 31. For TMVOC, if one of the two-phase functions is chosen, the NAPL relative permeability is assumed to be zero. For ECO2, the two-phase functions are only applicable when an aqueous phase and a single CO2-rich phase are present. If one of the two-phase functions is chosen, the relative permeability of the CO2-rich phase will be the same function of saturation, regardless whether the CO2-rich phase is liquid or gas. The notation used below is: _krl_ – aqueous phase relative permeability; _krg_ - gas (for all two-phase EOSs and TMVOC) or gaseous CO2 (for ECO2) phase relative permeability; _krn_ – NAPL (for TMVOC) or liquid CO2 (for ECO2) phase relative permeability. _Sl_, _Sg_, and _Sn_ are the saturations of aqueous, gas (or gaseous CO2) and NAPL (or liquid CO2) phases, respectively.
