# IRP=36  Faust for two-phase Buckley-Leverett problem

_IRP_ = 36         Functions used by Faust (1985) for two-phase Buckley-Leverett problem

&#x20;                        $$k_{rl}$$  = ( $$S_l$$ - 0.16)2/0.64

&#x20;                        $$k_{rg}$$  = 0

&#x20;                         $$k_{rn}$$  = (0.8 - $$S_l$$ )2/0.64

&#x20;                       where  $$k_{rl}$$  and  $$k_{rn}$$  are limited to values between 0 and 1, no parameters.
