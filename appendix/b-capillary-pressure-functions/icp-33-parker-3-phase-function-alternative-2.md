# ICP=33  Parker 3-phase function, alternative 2&#x20;

_ICP_ = 33         as _ICP_ = 31, except that the capillary pressures are modified for small gas saturations to reduce the derivative.



&#x20;   If $$S_l$$ +  $$S_n$$ > 0.99,

$${P_{cgn}}\quad  = \quad {P_{cgn}}\frac{{1 - {S_l} - {S_n}}}{{0.01}}$$

&#x20;If $$S_l$$ > 0.99,

$${P_{cnl}}\quad  = \quad {P_{cnl}}\frac{{1 - {S_l}}}{{0.01}}$$
