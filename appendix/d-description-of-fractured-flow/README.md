# ☑️ D: DESCRIPTION OF FRACTURED FLOW

Flow in fractured media can be simulated with different conceptual models. Some of the most popular models include dual-porosity, dual-permeability, discrete fracture network and MINC. All these approaches  can be realized in TOUGH4 with model mesh modification without any need in change of the modeling codes. &#x20;
