# Multiple Continuum Approaches

Dual-porosity and dual-permeability models require two-set overlapping mesh elements, one for fracture and the another for the matrix. The only difference between the two models is that the  dual-porosity model does not have connection among the matrix elements, but dual-permeability requires connections among the matrix elements. Dual-porosity is a speical case of MINC with two continua. Details for multiple-conuum mesh processing can be found in[ Section 8/Multiple-continuum processing](../../preparation-of-model-input/geometry-data/multiple-continuum-processing.md). Dual-permeability mesh can be created based on a dual-porosity mesh by adding connections for matrix elements (the matrix connections are fully corresponding to the connections for the fracture elements)
