# Accumulation Terms

The general form of the mass accumulation term that includes equilibrium sorption on the solid grains is:

$$M^\kappa\quad=\quad\varphi\sum_{\beta}{S_\beta\rho_\beta X_\beta^\kappa}+(1-\varphi)\rho_R\rho_lX_l^\kappa K_d$$                                 (4-2)

where $$\varphi$$ is porosity,  $$S_\beta$$is the saturation of phase $$\beta$$ (e.g., $$\beta$$ = gas, aqueous, non-aqueous phase liquid/oil),  $$\rho_\beta$$is the density of phase $$\beta$$_,_ and  $$X_\beta^\kappa$$is the mass fraction of component _k_ in phase $$\beta$$,  $$\rho_R$$is the rock grain density, and $$K_d$$ is the aqueous (liquid) phase distribution coefficient_._ The total mass of component _k_ is obtained by summing over the fluid phases $$\beta$$. The heat accumulation term in a multiphase system is

$$M^h\quad=\quad(1-\varphi)\rho_RC_RT+\varphi \sum _\beta S_βρ_βu_β$$                                         (4-3) &#x20;

where $$C_R$$is the specific heat of the rock grains, _T_ is temperature, and $$u_\beta$$is the specific internal energy of phase $$\beta$$.
