# Constant Temperature Boundary Conditions

Constant temperature boundary conditions but variable pressure, saturation, and mass fractions can be specified by setting rock grain density (DROK) to a very large value (e.g., $$10^{50}$$) or setting [element "Activety"](../../preparation-of-model-input/keywords-and-input-data/eleme.md) to "T". This option is useful for cases where the temperature of the injected fluid is maintained constant while the other primary variables defining the system state may vary with time.
