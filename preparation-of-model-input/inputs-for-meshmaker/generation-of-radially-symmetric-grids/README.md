# Generation of radially symmetric grids

Keyword RZ2D (or RZ2DL) invokes generation of a radially symmetric mesh. Nodal points will be placed half-way between neighboring radial interfaces. When RZ2D is specified, the mesh will be generated by columns; i.e., in the ELEME block we will first have the grid blocks at smallest radius for all layers, then the next largest radius for all layers, and so on. With keyword RZ2DL the mesh will be generated by layers; i.e., in the ELEME block we will first have all grid blocks for the first (top) layer from smallest to largest radius, then all grid blocks for the second layer, and so on. Apart from the different ordering of elements, the two meshes for RZ2D and RZ2DL are identical. The reason for providing the two alternatives is as a convenience to users in implementing boundary conditions by way of inactive elements (see Section 6). RZ2D makes it easy to declare a vertical column inactive, facilitating assignment of boundary conditions in the vertical, such as a gravitationally equilibrated pressure gradient. RZ2DL on the other hand facilitates implementation of areal (top and bottom layer) boundary conditions.
