# Problem 3 - Five-spot Geothermal Production/Injection (rfp)

In geothermal reservoir development, production and injection wells are often sited in more or less regular geometric patterns. The present problem considers a large well field with wells arranged in a “five-spot” configuration (Figure 8). Because of symmetry only 1/8 of the basic pattern needs to be modeled. The computational grid was generated by means of a separate preprocessor program which has not yet been integrated into the TOUGH3 package. The grid has six rows, each containing between one and eleven elements, for a total of thirty-six volume elements; for simplicity, only a single layer of 305 m thickness is modeled. The problem specifications as given in Table 3 correspond to conditions that may typically be encountered in deeper zones of hot and fairly tight fractured two-phase reservoirs (Pruess and Narasimhan, 1985).
