# Problem 4  - Coupled Wellbore Flow (r1q)

This example is from [EOS1 manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19jQ5UnMi8XPlm6PZp59NQr2p6D8Y55DZ/view?usp=drive\_link), sample 4 (r1q).

TOUGH4 allows to fully couple with wellbore simulation.  Users can also use a simple way to couple reservoir-wellbore flow through performing flowing wellbore pressure corrections using tabular data of flowing bottomhole pressure vs. flow rate and flowing enthalpy. This example shows the simple way for application of TOUGH4 to coupled reservoir-wellbore flow which is demonstrated with a geothermal production problem similar to Problem 1 of Hadgu et al. (1995).  A well of 0.2 m inside diameter produces from a 500 m thick two-phase reservoir containing water at initial conditions of P = 60 bars, T = Tsat(P) = 275.5 ËšC, Sg = 0.1. Wellhead pressure is 7 bars, and feed zone depth is 1000 m.

Detailed specifications of the model can be found in  [EOS1 manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19jQ5UnMi8XPlm6PZp59NQr2p6D8Y55DZ/view?usp=drive\_link).&#x20;

The key feature of the problem is the preparation of the tabular data used for flowing wellbore correction, which must be generated by means of a wellbore simulator ahead of a TOUGH4 run. TOUGH4 allows a flexible format of the table. The table can also be generated by TOUGH4 itself with turning on the wellbore simulation. &#x20;
