# Problem 2 - Heat Pipe in Cylindrical Geometry (rhp)

This problem is from the  sample problem No. 2  in TOUGH3/EOS4 user manual. It has also been simulated with EOS3. Details of problem setup can be found in [EOS3/problem 3](../eos3/problem-3-heat-pipe-in-cylindrical-geometry-rhp.md). The only difference between  EOS4 and EOS3 simulation is that the vapor pressure lowering is turn on in EOS4 simulation.&#x20;
