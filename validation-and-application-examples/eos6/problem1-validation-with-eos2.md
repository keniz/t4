# Problem1-Validation with EOS2

In geothermal reservoir development, production and injection wells are often sited in more or less regular geometric patterns. The present problem considers a large well field with wells arranged in a “five-spot” configuration (see Figure 10-n1). Because of symmetry, only 1/8 of the basic pattern needs to be modeled. The computational grid was generated by means of a separate preprocessor program which has not yet been integrated into the TOUGH4 package. The grid has six rows, each containing between one and eleven elements, for a total of thirty-six volume elements; for simplicity, only a single layer of 305 m thickness is modeled. The problem specifications as given in Figure 10-n2 correspond to conditions that may typically be encountered in deeper zones of hot and fairly tight fractured two-phase reservoirs (Pruess and Narasimhan, 1985)_._&#x20;

This example models the system as a fractured medium with embedded impermeable matrix blocks in the shape of cubes. The matrix blocks were assigned a non-vanishing porosity of $$10^{-10}$$, so that they will contain a small amount of water. This has no noticeable impact on fluid and heat flows, and is done to prevent the water mass balance equation from degenerating into the singular form 0 = 0. Running the problem with $$\phi=0$$ in the matrix blocks (domain MATRX) is also possible, but this results in more sluggish convergence and considerably smaller time steps. The MESHMaker module is used to perform MINC-partitioning of the primary grid (partition type THRED with three equal fracture spacings). The first MINC continuum, corresponding to the fracture domain, occupies a volume fraction of 0.02 and has an intrinsic porosity of 50 %, for an effective fracture porosity of 1 %. By inserting an ENDCY record in front of the MESHM data block, the MINC process can be disabled and the problem can be run as an effective porous medium. A CO2 partial pressure of 5 bars is specified. Figure 10-n3  shows the comparison of the simulation results with EOS6 and EOS2..
