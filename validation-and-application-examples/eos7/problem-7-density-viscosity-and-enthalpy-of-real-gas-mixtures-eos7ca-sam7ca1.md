# Problem 7-Density, Viscosity, and Enthalpy of Real Gas Mixtures (EOS7CA/SAM7CA1)

This example demonstrates the gas mixture property calculations of EOS7 and compares to the calculation results with TOUGH3/EOS7CA, which had been verified with independent reference values. The domain consists of six grid blocks arranged in two columns with three rows. No connections are among these elements. Different initial conditions representing various mass composition and phase condition are assigned to the elements  and the simulation is run for a single time step with tiny time-step size to obtain the thermal physical properties  corresponding to the given initial conditions. Followings are he input and output files for two simulations with different gas mixtures (CO2 and AIR, CH4 and AIR).&#x20;
